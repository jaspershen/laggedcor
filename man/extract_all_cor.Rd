\title{Extract All Correlations from an Object}
\usage{
extract_all_cor(object)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object that includes \code{all_cor} and \code{shift_time} attributes.}
}
\value{
A named vector where each name is the corresponding shift time and each value is the
correlation coefficient associated with that shift time.
}
\description{
Retrieves all correlation coefficients from a given object with predefined structure,
associating them with their respective shift times.
}
\details{
The function accesses the \code{all_cor} component from the input object, which is expected to contain
a series of correlation coefficients. It then retrieves the \code{shift_time} component from the same
object and uses it to name the elements in the \code{all_cor} vector, effectively binding each
correlation coefficient with its respective shift time. The resulting named vector is then
returned.
}
\note{
The \code{object} is assumed to have an accessible \code{all_cor} and \code{shift_time} attributes. This
function is useful for subsequent analysis where the relationship between correlation
coefficients and their corresponding shift times is needed.
